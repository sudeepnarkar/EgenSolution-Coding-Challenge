# Personal Weight Tracker

The goal of this project is to build a system that works like an IoT platform – in this case, a personal weight tracker. This system is responsible for

•	Consuming data sent from different sensors (emulators)

•	Storing the received data in MongoDB

•	Running the data through different rules to make basic predictions

Dependencies - 
1. Java - https://www.java.com/en/download/
2. Maven - https://maven.apache.org/
3. MongoDb - https://www.mongodb.com/download-center
4. Easy Rules - http://www.easyrules.org/
5. Emulator code - https://github.com/egen/sensor-emulator


Follow the below steps to run the project

1. Clone/Download the emulator from this location - https://github.com/egen/sensor-emulator

2. Build it by the command - mvn clean package (This creates a jar file in target directory 'sensor-emulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar')

3. Run it by the command - java -jar -Dbase.value=150 -Dapi.url=http://localhost:8080 sensor-emulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    Here - port number is 8090, Base weight is 150. These are customizable parameters.
    
4. The data generated by the execution will be consumed by the REST endpoints.

REST Endpoints/API exposed

**Metrics** - 

1. Create a metric

`POST => http://localhost:8090/metrics/create`

2. Read all metrics so far

`GET => localhost:8090/metrics/read`

3. Read metrics within a time range

`GET => localhost:8090/metrics/readByTimeRange?start={starttime}&end={endtime}`

**Alerts** - 

1. Read all alerts so far

`GET => localhost:8090/alerts/read`

2. Read alerts within a time range

`GET => localhost:8090/alerts/readByTimeRange?start={starttime}&end={endtime}`
